# DEX Operators Overview


## Introduction

The DEX operator is an entity that operates a decentralized exchange. His core assets are the digital asset trading pairs he operates, and his value is reflected through the management of digital asset trading pairs. Generally speaking, the DEX operator only needs to provide basic liquidity supply.

## Set Up a Website

Optionally, the DEX operator can choose to open a website to showcase its credibility and allow other partners in the ecosystem to get more information about himself, but this is not mandatory.
