# DEX Operators FAQ

### What is a DEX operator? Why do we need DEX operators?

The DEX operator is an entity that operates a decentralized exchange. His core assets are the digital asset trading pairs he operates, and his value is reflected through the operation structure utilised to manage digital asset trading pairs. Generally speaking, the DEX operator only needs to provide basic liquidity supply.

### DEX operator costs
The value of DEX operators is reflected through the operation activities of digital asset trading pairs. In the blockchain system, application developers only need to bear the development cost and the deployment cost of the DAPP application and don’t need to bear the server cost. The design fee is essentially the revenue of the block -generating node for selling its computing and storage resources. Therefore, all the fees are distributed to the block-generating nodes as revenue. That’s why it is mandatory to distribute the matching fee to the block-generating nodes in the traditional DEX scheme, as the block-generating nodes are the DEX operators. In OKExDEX, the DEX operators have been distinguished from the public chain operators, and the matching fee is returned to the DEX operators to solve the problem of low liquidity caused by the high cost of market-making.

### Product deposits

The core resources of a DEX operator are the digital asset trading pairs he listed. DEX operators who have digital assets trading pairs can deposit any number of OKT as product deposits. The digital asset trading pair has the attribute of product deposits. In the process of matching, the higher the product deposits the higher the probability that the pair order will be matched.
