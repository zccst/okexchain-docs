## 1.how to solve the error of mismatch transaction hash when using `ethers.js`.
#### Solution
* install the package of `exchain-etherjs`(which was released by team of ExChain ) via npm 
```shell script
sudo npm install exchain-ethers
```
* using `exchain-ethers.js` to instead the original `ethers.js`

#### Root cause
The `ethers.js` will generate a transaction hash in local via the algorithm of ethereum that using RLP+KECCAK256, as we know the exchain was based on cosmos-sdk, it use the algorithm of cosmos style to generate a transaction hash(Amino + SHA256), that's a huge inconsistent, it will failed when `ethers.js` try to get result of transaction execution via using the ethereum style hash on exchain
